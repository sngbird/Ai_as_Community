To run the game:

In the terminal inside of the folder with requiremnets.txt, run
	pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs the required programs to run the game. Then, enter the src file and run
	python run.py

If this does not work, replace python with whatever your computer refers to python as (py, py3, etc) and try again. If it works, then you're ready to enjoy the game!
