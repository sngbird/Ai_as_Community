    <Character name="BucketKnight">
        <Background>
            <Description name="Ever since he was a little boy, the bucket knight wanted to become a great and righteous royal knight. For years (from childhood to adulthood), he trained for knighthood wearing a makeshift helmet he crafted from a nearby bucket he found as a child. (The bucket was always too big for his head until he fully grew into it as an adult). However, when he finally had his chance, he was deemed by his kingdom to be unfit for knighthood. He was a reckless and clumsy warrior who frequently embarrassed himself trying to help others in need. Heartbroken by this outcome, the bucket knight ran off (sobbing uncontrollably) on a grand quest to slay the demon king, hoping to prove his worthiness as a knight."/>

No one knows if she has an actual name because whenever anyone asks, she ends up getting sidetracked by going on strange, nonsensical rambles. This dream world depends on maintaining a certain minimum level of worldwide mental peace, and the demon king&apos;s growing presence has caused a rise in the number of nightmares experienced: compromising this land&apos;s safety. Only defeating the demon king can save the dream world from imminent destruction… THIS is not the reason the sheep girl wants to defeat the demon king. She got really into weapon enchantment as a hobby and wants to try out her dream-infused morning star on him."/>
